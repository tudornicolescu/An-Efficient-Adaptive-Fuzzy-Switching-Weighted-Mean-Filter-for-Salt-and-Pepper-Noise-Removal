# An-Efficient-Adaptive-Fuzzy-Switching-Weighted-Mean-Filter-for-Salt-and-Pepper-Noise-Removal
I implemented the salt-and-pepper noise removal technique as it was described in the research paper with the same name as the project. This was part of a mandatory university project. The research paper is not mine and it was cited in the final presentation.

The paper that described the algorithm can be found at:
